You will be provided with a Markdown document containing several code blocks. Your task is to process this document by assigning a file name to each code block that is labeled as javascript or typescript, then insert this file name as an H6 header above the corresponding code block.

Follow these instructions exactly:

Identify Code Blocks:

Only process code blocks that are wrapped in javascript or typescript. Ignore other code blocks.
Assign File Name:

For each identified code block, analyze its content and determine a relevant file name as an H6 header (formatted as ###### filename.js or ###### filename.ts) based on the code's purpose.
Use .js for JavaScript code and .ts for TypeScript code.
The file name should be descriptive of the code's functionality, using common JavaScript/TypeScript naming conventions.
Insert File Name:

Insert the assigned file name as an H6 header (formatted as ###### filename.js or ###### filename.ts) directly above each processed code block.
Return the Document:

Return the full modified Markdown document with the inserted file names.
